# OS-HomeworkAssignments
This repository contains all of my C programming assignments from my Comp530 Intro to Operating Systems Class taken at UNC Chapel Hill. 
Homework2 focuses on parsing an array of characters from standard input and creating a child process to then exec those commands if they are valid. 
Homework3 utilizes a bounded buffer with semaphores to allow a producer and consumer pthread to take characters from standard input and replace newlines with spaces and pairs of asterisks with an ampersand.
Homework4 uses pipes to allows forked child processes to act as consumers to parse characters and replace newlines with spaces and pairs of asterisks with a single ampersand.
Homework5 uses sockets to create a client server connection that uses a shared file that forked child processes from the server can use to parse characters and replace newlines with spaces and pairs of asterisks with a single ampersand.
Homework6 creates a buffer Abstract Data Type and a shared Memory Map to allow child processes to operate on a buffer of characters and replace newlines with spaces and pairs of asterisks with a single ampersand. 
This repository exists to show off the C concepts I leared during my class and hopefully illustrates my proficiency with the C programming language and operating systems in general.
